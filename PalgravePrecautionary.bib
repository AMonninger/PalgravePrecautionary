                   preferences. This article develops a measure of

                   tohypothetical income gambles in the Health and
                   Retirement Study. In contrast to most survey measures
                   that produce an ordinal metric, thisarticle shows how
                   to construct a cardinal proxy for the risk tolerance
                   of each survey respondent. The article also shows how
                   to accountfor measurement error in estimating this
                   proxy and how to obtain consistent regression
                   estimates despite the measurement error. The
                   risktolerance proxy is shown to explain differences
                   in asset allocation across households.},
